                    <h2>Understanding HRA Documentation Requirements</h2>
                    <p>
                        When claiming House Rent Allowance (HRA) tax benefits, many employees are unsure about which documents
                        are mandatory. Let's clarify the documentation requirements to ensure your HRA claims are processed smoothly.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Are Both Rent Agreement and Receipts Mandatory?</h2>
                    <p>
                        While rent receipts are essential, a registered rent agreement is not always mandatory. However,
                        having both documents strengthens your claim. The Income Tax Department may scrutinize HRA claims
                        more closely in certain situations:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>High rental payments relative to income</li>
                        <li>Significant year-on-year increase in rent</li>
                        <li>Rent claims without proper documentation</li>
                        <li>Suspicious or incomplete rent receipts</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Documentation Based on Rental Amount</h2>
                    <p>
                        The documentation requirements vary depending on your annual rent amount:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For rent below ₹1 lakh per year: Rent receipts are sufficient</li>
                        <li>For rent above ₹1 lakh per year:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Rent receipts</li>
                                <li>Landlord's PAN details</li>
                                <li>Rent agreement (recommended)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Additional Supporting Documents</h2>
                    <p>
                        To strengthen your HRA claim, consider maintaining these additional documents:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bank statements showing rent payments</li>
                        <li>Communication records with landlord</li>
                        <li>Utility bills of rented property</li>
                        <li>Property tax receipts (if available)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Best Practices for Documentation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Follow these guidelines to ensure your HRA claims are well-documented:
                    </p>

                    </ul>

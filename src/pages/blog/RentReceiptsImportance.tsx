                    <h2>The Significance of Rent Receipts</h2>
                    <p>
                        For salaried individuals in India, rent receipts serve as essential documents for claiming House Rent Allowance (HRA) benefits.
                        These documents not only help you save taxes but also serve as proof of your rental payments during tax assessments.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Tax Benefits Through HRA Claims</h2>
                    <p>
                        When you receive HRA as part of your salary, proper rent receipts can help you claim tax exemptions under Section 10(13A)
                        of the Income Tax Act. Without valid rent receipts, your entire HRA becomes taxable, potentially increasing your tax liability significantly.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Key Components of a Valid Rent Receipt</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tenant's full name and address</li>
                        <li>Landlord's complete details including name and address</li>
                        <li>Rental amount (both in figures and words)</li>
                        <li>Period of rent payment</li>
                        <li>Date of payment</li>
                        <li>Landlord's signature</li>
                        <li>Revenue stamp for amounts exceeding ₹5000</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
                    <p>
